/**
 * State Management Utilities
 * 
 * This file can be used for state management needs that don't require persistence.
 * For persistent state, use Zustand stores in the /store directory.
 * 
 * This follows a local-first approach, where state is managed close to where it's used
 * but can be extracted to a Zustand store if persistence is needed later.
